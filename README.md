Dart annotations for declarative RDF graph mapping and code generation.

## Overview

[üåê **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_mapper_annotations/)

`rdf_mapper_annotations` provides an elegant solution for transforming between Dart object models and RDF graphs, similar to an ORM for databases. This enables developers to work with semantic data in an object-oriented manner without manually managing the complexity of transforming between dart objects and RDF triples.

## Part of a whole family of projects

If you are looking for more rdf-related functionality, have a look at our companion projects:

* basic graph classes as well as turtle/jsonld/n-triple encoding and decoding: [rdf_core](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_core) 
* encode and decode rdf/xml format: [rdf_xml](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_xml) 
* easy-to-use constants for many well-known vocabularies: [rdf_vocabularies](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabularies)
* generate your own easy-to-use constants for other vocabularies with a build_runner: [rdf_vocabulary_to_dart](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabulary_to_dart)
