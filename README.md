Dart annotations for declarative RDF graph mapping and code generation.

## Overview

[üåê **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_mapper_annotations/)

`rdf_mapper_annotations` provides an elegant solution for transforming between Dart object models and RDF graphs, similar to an ORM for databases. This enables developers to work with semantic data in an object-oriented manner without manually managing the complexity of transforming between dart objects and RDF triples.

## Quick Start

1. Add dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rdf_core: ^latest
  rdf_mapper: ^latest
  rdf_mapper_annotations: ^latest
  rdf_vocabularies: ^latest # Optional but recommended

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^latest
  rdf_mapper_generator: ^latest
```

2. Define your data model with RDF annotations:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_core/rdf_core.dart';
import 'package:rdf_mapper_annotations/rdf_mapper_annotations.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/schema.dart';

@RdfGlobalResource(SchemaBook.classIri, RdfIri('http://example.org/book/{id}'))
class Book {
  @RdfIriPart('id')
  final String id;

  @RdfProperty(SchemaBook.name)
  final String title;

  @RdfProperty(SchemaBook.author)
  final String author;

  @RdfProperty(SchemaBook.hasPart)
  final List<Chapter> chapters;

  Book({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    required this.author,
    required this.chapters,
  });
}

@RdfLocalResource(SchemaChapter.classIri)
class Chapter {
  @RdfProperty(SchemaChapter.name)
  final String title;

  @RdfProperty(SchemaChapter.position)
  final int number;

  Chapter(this.title, this.number);
}
```

3. Generate mappers:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

4. Use the generated mappers:

```dart
void main() {
  // Initialize the generated mapper
  final mapper = initRdfMapper();
  
  // Create a book with chapters
  final book = Book(
    id: '123',
    title: 'RDF Mapping with Dart',
    author: 'Klas Kala√ü',
    chapters: [
      Chapter('Getting Started', 1),
      Chapter('Advanced Mapping', 2),
    ],
  );
  
  // Convert to RDF graph
  final graph = mapper.serialize(book);
  print(graph.toString());
  
  // Parse back to Dart object
  final parsedBook = mapper.deserialize<Book>(graph);
  print(parsedBook.title); // 'RDF Mapping with Dart'
}
```

## Part of a whole family of projects

If you are looking for more rdf-related functionality, have a look at our companion projects:

* basic graph classes as well as turtle/jsonld/n-triple encoding and decoding: [rdf_core](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_core) 
* encode and decode rdf/xml format: [rdf_xml](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_xml) 
* easy-to-use constants for many well-known vocabularies: [rdf_vocabularies](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabularies)
* generate your own easy-to-use constants for other vocabularies with a build_runner: [rdf_vocabulary_to_dart](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabulary_to_dart)
